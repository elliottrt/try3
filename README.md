# try3
My third try at writing an operating system.

Very little of this code is commented, so read at your own risk.

Some of this code is borrowed from people such as JDH and many others.
If you recognize any of it and I've not attributed it, its because I
wrote this across the span of a year and I am very forgetful. Sorry.

There is also no guarantee this will boot, or that you have various
requirements installed.

Good luck.
